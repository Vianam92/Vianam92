###  A little more about me...  
<p>I studied accounting, I have been introducing myself and learning on my own about this world of programming for a few years. And since it is constantly changing and every day it proposes new challenges, it is perfect for me.</p>
<p>I am a very curious person, a perfectionist, I always like to be learning something new, I am proactive and I put my heart and commitment to all my life and professional projects.</p>
